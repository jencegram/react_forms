# React Forms Exercise

## Introduction

As a beginner in React, this exercise allowed me to create a dynamic application where users can interact with forms and see immediate results on the UI.

## Project Overview

This project is a simple React application where users can add and remove colored boxes from a list. Each box's dimensions and color are customizable through a user-friendly form. It's a hands-on way to learn about components, state, and props in React.

## Key Learnings

- Creating functional components in React.
- Managing state with hooks like `useState`.
- Handling form inputs and submissions.
- Dynamically rendering lists based on state.
- Writing basic tests for components.

## Running the Application

To get this application up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, as it's required to run a React application.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
https://github.com/jencegram/react_forms.git

2. Change directory to the project folder:

3. Install the necessary dependencies:


### Starting the Application

Run the application in development mode:
npm start

This will open the application in your default web browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Running Tests

Execute the following command to run the tests:
npm test

This command runs the test suite and provides output on the test results.
